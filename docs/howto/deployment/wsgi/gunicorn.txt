How to use Django with Gunicorn
===============================

.. highlight:: bash

Gunicorn_ ('Green Unicorn') is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It's a
pre-fork worker model ported from Ruby's Unicorn project.

.. _Gunicorn: http://gunicorn.org/

There are two ways to use Gunicorn with Django. One is to have Gunicorn treat
Django as just another WSGI application. The second is to use Gunicorn's
special `integration with Django`_.

.. _integration with Django: http://gunicorn.org/run.html#django-manage-py_

Running Django in Gunicorn as a generic WSGI application
========================================================

When Gunicorn is installed, a ``gunicorn`` command is available which starts
the Gunicorn server process. At its simplest, gunicorn just needs to be called
with a the location of a WSGI application object.::

    gunicorn [OPTIONS] APP_MODULE

Where ``APP_MODULE`` is of the pattern ``MODULE_NAME:VARIABLE_NAME``. The
module name should be a full dotted path. The variable name refers to a WSGI
callable that should be found in the specified module.

So for a typical Django project, invoking gunicorn would look like::

    gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application

(This requires that your project be on the Python path; the simplest way to
ensure that is to run this command from the same directory as your
``manage.py`` file.)


Using Gunicorn's Django integration
===================================

Gunicorn also provides Django integration. You can add ``"gunicorn"`` to
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, and use the ``run_gunicorn`` management command in
place of :djadmin:`runserver`.

This provides a few Django-specific niceties:

* sets the gunicorn process name to be that of the project

* validates installed models

* allows an ``--adminmedia`` option for passing in the location of the
  admin media files, mimicing the behavior of runserver.

See Gunicorn's `deployment documentation`_ for additional tips on starting and
maintaining the Gunicorn server.
