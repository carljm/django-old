Django 1.5 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

This page documents release notes for the as-yet-unreleased Django
1.5. As such, it's tentative and subject to change. It provides
up-to-date information for those who are following trunk.

Django 1.5 includes various `new features`_ and some minor `backwards
incompatible changes`_. There are also some features that have been dropped,
which are detailed in :doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`, and
we've `begun the deprecation process for some features`_.

What's new in Django 1.5
========================

Template based form rendering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The form to HTML rendering in the past was hardcoded in the python source
files and though hard to extend and hard to override. Therefor is now a
template based rendering available that outputs complete forms in a paragraph
based layout (formerly ``as_p()``), list based (``as_ul``) or as a table
(``as_table``). It is possible to break down the rendering into different
styled rows and to customize widgets right from the template.

An additional template loader (``django.template.loaders.forms.Loader``) that
loads widget templates is enabled by default and will be until Django 1.6.

Read :doc:`/topics/forms/rendering` for more details about the new template
based rendering.

Widgets API
~~~~~~~~~~~

The form widgets now have a :doc:`public API<../ref/forms/widgets>` for easier
custom rendering and like the rest of the form library is the widget rendering
now done using Django templates.

HTML comparisons in tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase` base class provided by django has
now some helpers to compare HTML on it's semantical equivilance. Basic
differences like argument quoting and how self-closing tags are closed are
ignored. HTML can either be compared directly with the new
:meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertHTMLEqual` and
:meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertHTMLNotEqual` assertions or use
the ``html=True`` flag with
:meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertContains` and
:meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertNotContains` to test if the test
client's response contains a HTML fragment. See the :ref:`assertion
documentation<assertions>` for more information.

``assertTemplateUsed`` as context managers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to check whether a template was used or not in a block of
code with the :meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertTemplateUsed` and
:meth:`~django.test.testcase.TestCase.assertTemplateNotUsed` assertions. They
can be used as a context manager::

    with self.assertTemplateUsed('index.html'):
        render_to_string('index.html')
    with self.assertTemplateNotUsed('base.html'):
        render_to_string('index.html')

See the :ref:`assertion documentation<assertions>` for more information.

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.5
=====================================

Private widgets API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the addition of a template-based widgets API, parts of the
widgets API have been deprecated. They weren't considered as public parts and
if you use standard widgets, backwards compatibility applies. However, if you
have custom widgets defined using the mechanisms above, you will need to
update them to the new API:

* ``MultiWidget``'s ``format_output`` method has been deprecated. Existing
  implementations of ``format_output`` to add data between widgets won't have
  any effect.

* ``RadioSelect``'s ``renderer`` API has been deprecated. Direct call to
  ``RadioSelect``'s ``get_renderer()`` method still works but assiging a
  custom renderer to ``RadioSelect`` won't have any impact on the rendering.

* Any widget's ``render`` method should now accept the optional
  ``template_name``, ``extra_context`` and ``context_instance`` arguments.
  Update your custom widgets to reflect that change. It is recommended that
  your :class:`~django.forms.widgets.Widget` subclasses accept a ``**kwargs``
  argument in the ``render`` method.
